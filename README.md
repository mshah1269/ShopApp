# ShopApp
Shopping App is developed using react native . React-navigation, Redux and React hooks are used in this application


# How to use

To run this project locally, run the following commands:

1. npm install
2. npm start

Since this project is React Native and iOS and/or Android Simulator will need to be configured on the computer.
Or you can scan the barcode with Expo App to load it.

I personally use expo to have my local testing environment ready, it is highly recommended.
